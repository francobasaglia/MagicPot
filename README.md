Arduino library for read values easily from potentiometers.

## Description

**MagicPot** is a little Arduino Library for read values easily from potentiometers. It has several configurations in order to:
* Obtain a mapped *value* on a desire range.
* Work with 10 or 12 bits resolution boards.
* Define a *callback function* whenever the read from the potentiometer changes.
* Define a *sensitivity* value at reading time - usefully for noisy potentiometers.

## Installation
You can install this library using **Arduino Library Manager**, or downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/francobasaglia/MagicPot/releases) from GitHub repository
